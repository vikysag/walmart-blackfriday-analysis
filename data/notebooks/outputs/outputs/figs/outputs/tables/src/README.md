# Source Code Folder (`src`)

This folder contains modular Python scripts used across notebooks:
- `eda.py` → data loading, cleaning, descriptive stats
- `stats_tests.py` → t-tests, bootstrap sampling, CLT simulations
- `viz.py` → helper functions for plots and charts

These will be filled step-by-step.
